# Test Coverage Analysis Report

## Coverage Summary
**Overall Coverage: ~95%** - The test suite provides excellent coverage of the 11 main journeys with extensive edge case testing.

## Journey-by-Journey Analysis

### ‚úÖ Fully Covered Journeys (10/11)

1. **6.1 List All Sessions** - Thoroughly tested including edge cases for empty directories, corrupted files, sessions with/without summaries, and mixed active/inactive sessions.

2. **6.2 Create New Session** - Complete coverage including validation, error handling, bootstrap messages, and JSON compaction.

3. **6.3 Resume Existing Session** - Comprehensive testing of session ID extraction from various message positions, error handling, and working directory consistency.

4. **6.4 Get Session from Disk** - Well-tested including 404 handling, complex JSON structures, and content preservation.

5. **6.5 Multiple WebSocket Clients** - Excellent coverage of broadcasting, echoing, and sequential message handling.

6. **6.6 Session with No Connected Clients** - Properly tests output discarding and no-buffering behavior.

7. **6.8 Graceful Shutdown** - Covered via TestServer infrastructure, though could use explicit signal testing.

8. **6.9 Tool Approval Request Flow** - Complete end-to-end testing of approval flow.

9. **6.10 Approval Request Denial** - Fully tested denial flow and Claude continuation.

10. **6.11 Multiple Pending Approvals** - Well-tested accumulation and broadcasting to new clients.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Covered Journey (1/11)

**6.7 Claude Process Dies** - Basic death handling is tested, but missing:
- WebSocket client notification with status 1011
- Session removal from active map verification
- GET endpoint behavior after process death

## Issues and Missing Edge Cases

### üî¥ Critical Gaps
1. **Journey 6.7 (Claude Process Dies)**: The test doesn't verify WebSocket close status 1011 or proper session cleanup from the active sessions map.

### üü° Missing Edge Cases
1. **Session Discovery (5.2)**: No explicit test for orphaned summaries or corrupted UUID references.
2. **Error Handling Matrix (Section 9)**: Several error conditions lack explicit tests:
   - Session ID mismatch between filename and content
   - Write to dead Claude process
   - Malformed JSON from Claude causing WebSocket closure

3. **Approval System**: Missing test for Claude timeout on approval responses.
4. **Write Queue**: No explicit test for queue clearing when Claude process dies.
5. **Bootstrap Messages**: No test for extremely large bootstrap message arrays.

### üü† Test Correctness Issues
1. **Session Resume Tests**: While comprehensive, they don't verify that the old session ID placeholder is properly removed from tracking.
2. **Graceful Shutdown**: Relies on Drop trait but doesn't test explicit SIGTERM/SIGINT handling or the SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT behavior.
3. **Multiple Clients**: Tests don't verify strict FIFO order of write queue processing.

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Fix Journey 6.7 tests** to verify WebSocket status codes and session cleanup
2. **Add explicit graceful shutdown tests** with signal handling
3. **Add session ID mismatch detection tests** between filename and content

### Medium Priority
1. **Add orphaned summary handling tests**
2. **Add Claude timeout tests** for approval responses
3. **Add write queue FIFO ordering verification**
4. **Add malformed Claude JSON handling tests**

### Low Priority
1. **Add performance/load tests** for many concurrent sessions
2. **Add bootstrap message size limit tests**
3. **Add integration tests** combining multiple journeys

## Positive Observations
- Excellent use of helper modules and mock Claude implementation
- Strong async/await testing patterns
- Good separation of concerns between different test files
- Comprehensive WebSocket communication testing
- Robust approval system testing with multiple client scenarios

The test suite is mature and well-structured, with only minor gaps that should be straightforward to address.
