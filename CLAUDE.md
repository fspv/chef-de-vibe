- Run linter with `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`
- Run tests with `cargo nextest run` for parallel execution (much faster than `cargo test`)
  - Install nextest first with: `cargo install cargo-nextest --locked`
  - Tests run in isolated processes, avoiding environment variable conflicts
  - Use `cargo nextest run --no-fail-fast` to run all tests even if some fail
- To create a new app version
  - update Cargo.toml
  - update frontend/package.json
  - update version in `flake.nix`
  - run `CLAUDE_BINARY_PATH=missing nix run` and update hash in `flake.nix` if needed (it is fine if it fails with binary not found, it means it has been built correctly)
  - run builds to update any lock files if needed
  - commit a change
  - create a git tag with the version, for example v0.2.3
